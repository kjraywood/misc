# Guide to Using Jitsi Meet with BBO

## Some Background

*Jitsi Meet* is totally anonymous
  * there are no accounts, therefore no registration etc.
  * any info you choose add to your profile such as name, email
    address is saved only on your device and only shared with other
    participants; it doesn't go to the servers

Therefore, there is no built-in mechanism to invite anyone because the
servers don't know how to contact you.

## What Device?

If you can, it's preferable to use
  * a desktop computer with a camera in or on top of the monitor
  * a laptop on your desk with the camera at head height -- you might
    need to put the laptop on a stack of books and use an external
    mouse

because

  * we get a more natural view of you looking straight at the camera
    instead of downwards to a phone or tablet
  * it's easy to do things like mute or unmute your sound if you don't
    need to touch your phone

When also using BBO, you can shrink the Jitsi-Meet window and have it
beside the BBO window, or on a second monitor.

## If you must use your phone or tablet

During a meeting, use your phone in landscape mode to match what the
PC and laptop users do. Mount it at head height just beside or above
your computer screen.
